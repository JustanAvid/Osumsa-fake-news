    <h1>Bedbug Outbreak at Faruq Medical Hostel</h1>
    <p>
      Students of Faruq Medical Hostel have expressed their displeasure regarding a recent<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" style="color:red; font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">
  üö® I'm mad alr üö®
</marquee> outbreak of bedbugs 
      in their residence. The situation has sparked frustration among the occupants, who are calling on the 
      university management to intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an interview with <strong>Tutu Morrie</strong>, a 400-level resident of the hostel, she revealed that there 
      had been earlier signs of bedbugs, which were reported to the school authorities. However, she lamented that 
      no concrete action was taken to address the problem at the time.
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
      ‚ÄúThe fact that the school didn‚Äôt do anything regarding the signs we saw probably led to the boom of the bedbugs. 
      I call on the school to take immediate action in order to exterminate them as they are affecting our stay in the hostel,‚Äù 
      Morrie stated.
    </div>
    <p>
      Students are now urging the administration to take swift measures to ensure the hostel is properly fumigated, 
      restoring a safe and comfortable living environment.
